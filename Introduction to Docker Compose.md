What is Docker Compose?: Docker Compose helps you run multiple Docker containers together. Think of it as an organizer for all the parts of your application, like the web server, database, and any other services. 

Key Features of Docker Compose: 

docker-compose.yml file: This file lists all the services your application needs. You write down what each service is and how they should run. 

Commands: With Docker Compose, you can use simple commands to start, stop, and manage all your containers at once. No need to handle them one by one. 

Networking: Docker Compose automatically connects your containers, so they can easily talk to each other.

Importance in DevOps: Docker Compose is essential in DevOps for a few reasons: 

Makes Development and Testing Easier: It allows you to quickly set up the environment you need for coding and testing. 

Ensures Consistency: Everyone on your team will have the same setup, which helps avoid the 'it works on my machine' problem. 

Enhances Teamwork: It simplifies sharing the setup with your team, making collaboration smoother.
